# openshift-auto-csr

OpenShift manages internal TLS certificates and will automatically approve
certificate signing requests (CSRs) under normal circumstances.

If you frequently turn off your OpenShift cluster (lab, etc.), you'll quickly
find that if a certificate expires while the cluster is powered off, OpenShift
will **NOT** automatically renew that certificate.

Instead, OpenShift will generate pending CSRs will hang indefinitely until
manually approved with `oc adm cerficiate approve`.

This Helm chart deploys a CronJob that will check for any pending CSRs and
automatically approve them every 5 minutes. **This is only meant for lab (or
similar environment) clusters due to the security implications of blindly
approving pending CSRs.**

## How to Use

Deploy this on your cluster with:

* `helm install --namespace auto-csr --create-namespace auto-csr .`

You should now be able to power off the cluster, wait 3 months, and power it
back on without any issues due to expired (internal) certificates. ðŸ˜Ž
